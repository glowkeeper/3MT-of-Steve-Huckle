My work investigates how blockchain technology is a means by which communities can collaborate.

Blockchain technology underpins Bitcoin; a digital currency, whereby you transfer value by providing an electronic signature, a process akin to signing a cheque.

Aside from Bitcoin, blockchains lend themselves to some fascinating applications. Why? Because blockchains are a very capable distributed database, and in our present Information Age, data is King (unless, of course, you work for Cambridge Analytica).

A blockchain is formed by blocks of information based on a chain of transactions - hence the name. The technology is independent of any controlling entity because nodes on its network are equally privileged. They also have inbuilt capabilities for secure communication. Therefore, blockchains include properties desirable for trusted cooperation; in essence, they are the means by which you and I can freely collaborate.

My work looks at demonstrating blockchain's collaborative potential in three areas. The first is financial technologies. I wrote a paper discussing a distributed currency exchange, which the Indian Government, in a drive to digitise its economy, could have used for exchanging Rupees into Bitcoin, thereby banking the unbanked. The second area is provenance. My article on Fake News describes a picture that a prominent supporter of Donald Trump claimed showed the Clinton Campaign doctoring votes. I describe a scenario where the picture's photographer shows its origins using my blockchain app'. Then, the New York Times, who went to great lengths to prove the picture was fake, could have saved itself a lot of bother. Finally, I am developing a blockchain-based application for increasing the transparency of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian financing is often criticised on the grounds that the money is used fraudulently. Fortunately, by recording the whole funding process on the blockchain, it is possible to increase transparency and address those objections.

While those applications demonstrate that blockchains do indeed provide the technical capabilities for collaboration, my thesis also discusses significant barriers towards the technology's wide-scale adoption. Blockchain's flat (non-hierarchical) architecture is not necessarily how Capitalist Society currently organises itself. So I'll finish with a call to arms. My dear audience, if like me, you believe inequality is best addressed by challenging traditional hierarchies, then, just as the #metoo campaign has begun to undermine patriarchal power structures, it is up to all of us to say: "enough is enough!" Go and create, participate and collaborate with your peers - I challenge you to refute those traditional hierarchical power structures, show that flat and cooperative is best, and Be the Change You Wish To See in the World.
