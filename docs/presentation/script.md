My work investigates how blockchain technology is a means by which communities can collaborate.

Blockchain technology underpins Bitcoin; a digital currency where you transfer value by providing an electronic signature, a process akin to signing a cheque.

Blockchains have applications aside from Bitcoin, too. That's because a blockchain is a very capable distributed database, a prized quality in our present Information Age, where data is King (unless, of course, you are Cambridge Analytica).

Blockchains are formed by blocks of information based on a chain of transactions - hence the name. The technology is independent of any controlling entity because nodes on its network are equally privileged. They also include numerous security measures; properties that lead to a system ideally suited for trusted cooperation.

My work looks at demonstrating blockchain's collaborative potential in three areas. The first is financial technologies, where I wrote a paper discussing a distributed currency exchange, which the Indian Government, in its drive to digitise their economy, could have used for exchanging Rupees into Bitcoin, thereby banking the unbanked. The second area is provenance. My article on Fake News describes a photo that a prominent supporter of Donald Trump claimed showed the Clinton Campaign doctoring votes. The New York Times went to great lengths to prove the picture was fake; I create a scenario where the paper is saved a lot of trouble because the photographer used my blockchain app' to prove the photo's origins. Finally, I am developing a blockchain-based app' for increasing the transparency of humanitarian aid. People criticise humanitarian financing because the money is, supposedly, used fraudulently. Fortunately, by recording the whole funding process on the blockchain, it is possible to increase transparency and address those objections.

Those applications demonstrate that blockchains are the technical means by which you and I can freely collaborate. However, my thesis also discusses significant barriers towards the technology's wide-scale adoption because blockchain's flat (non-hierarchical) architecture is not necessarily how Capitalist Society currently organises itself. So I'll finish with a call to arms. My dear audience, if like me, you believe inequality is best addressed by challenging traditional hierarchies, then, just as the #metoo campaign has begun to undermine patriarchal power structures, it is up to all of us to say: "enough is enough!" Go and create, participate and collaborate with your peers - I challenge you to refute those established hierarchical power structures, show that flat and cooperative is best, and Be the Change You Wish To See in the World.
