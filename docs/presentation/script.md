My work investigates whether blockchain technology is the means by which communities can collaborate.

Blockchain technology underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which is a digital currency with cryptographic capabilities, whereby you transfer value by providing a digital signature, making the process somewhat analogous to that of signing a cheque.

Aside from Bitcoin, blockchains themselves have garnered much interest recently because the technology lends itself to some fascinating applications. Why is that? Well, in essence, blockchains are a very capable distributed database, and in our present Information Age, data is King (unless, of course, you work for Cambridge Analytica).

A blockchain is formed by blocks of information based on a chain of transactions - hence the name. What's more, the technology is independent of any single (controlling) entity because nodes on a blockchain network are equally privileged and mutually cooperative. Moreover, those nodes have inbuilt capabilities for secure communication. Hence, blockchains include properties desirable for trusted cooperation; in essence, they are the means by which you and I can freely collaborate.

My work looks at demonstrating blockchain's collaborative capabilities by developing applications in three areas. The first is financial technologies. To that end, I wrote a paper whose focus was India's drive to provide banking facilities for the vast proportion of its population who have none. That paper discusses a distributed currency exchange, which I argue the Indian Government could have used for exchanging Rupees into Bitcoin, and thereby, banking the unbanked. The second area is provenance. In a paper on Fake News, I describe a picture misappropriated by a prominent supporter of Donald Trump, who falsely claimed it showed the Clinton Campaign doctoring votes. The New York Times went to great lengths to prove the picture was fake, but in the article, I argue that if the photographer had used the blockchain app' I wrote for proving the ownership of digital media, the New York Times could have been saved an awful lot of bother. Finally, I am developing a blockchain-based application for increasing the transparency of humanitarian aid. Transparency is a key weapon against corruption and evidence from the UK suggests that it is necessary because humanitarian financing is criticised due to the belief that much of the money is used fraudulently. Fortunately, by recording the whole funding process on the blockchain, I believe it is possible to increase transparency and address those objections.

However, although those applications demonstrate that, yes, blockchains do indeed provide the technical capabilities that allow for collaboration, my thesis will also discuss significant barriers towards the technology's widescale adoption. That's because blockchain's flat (non-hierarchical) architecture is not necessarily the way in which Capitalist Society currently organises itself. So my talk finishes with a call to arms. My dear audience, if like me, you believe that inequality is best addressed by challenging traditional hierarchies, then, similar to how the #metoo campaign has begun to undermine patriarchal power structures, it is up to all of us to say: "enough is enough!" My challenge to you is to go and create, participate and collaborate with your peers, perhaps by volunteering with a homeless charity, or by forming an inspirational, socially aware cooperative (that finally brings that great socially aware idea of yours to fruition). In essence, my challenge to you is to refute those traditional hierarchical power structures, show that flat and cooperative is best, and Be the Change You Wish To See in the World.
