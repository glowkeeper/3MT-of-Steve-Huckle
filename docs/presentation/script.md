My work investigates how blockchain technology is a means by which communities can collaborate.

Blockchain technology underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin - a digital currency with cryptographic capabilities, whereby you transfer value by providing a digital signature, a process akin to signing a cheque.

Aside from Bitcoin, blockchains themselves have garnered much interest because the technology lends itself to some fascinating applications. Why? Because blockchains are a very capable distributed database, and in our present Information Age, data is King (unless, of course, you work for Cambridge Analytica)

A blockchain is formed by blocks of information based on a chain of transactions - hence the name. The technology is independent of any single (controlling) entity because nodes on a blockchain network are equally privileged and mutually cooperative. Those nodes have inbuilt capabilities for secure communication. Therefore, blockchains include properties desirable for trusted cooperation; in essence, they are the means by which you and I can freely collaborate.

My work looks at demonstrating blockchain's collaborative capabilities by developing applications in three areas. The first is financial technologies. I wrote a paper discussing a distributed currency exchange, which the Indian Government, in a drive to digitise its economy, could have used for exchanging Rupees into Bitcoin, thereby banking the unbanked. The second area is provenance. My paper on Fake News describes a picture misappropriated by a prominent supporter of Donald Trump, who claimed it showed the Clinton Campaign doctoring votes. The New York Times went to great lengths to prove the picture was fake, I argue that had the photographer used the blockchain app' I wrote for proving the ownership of digital media, the New York Times could have been saved an lot of bother. Finally, I am developing a blockchain-based application for increasing the transparency of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian financing is often criticised on the grounds that the money is used fraudulently. Fortunately, by recording the whole funding process on the blockchain, it is possible to increase transparency and address those objections.

While those applications demonstrate that blockchains do indeed provide the technical capabilities that allow for collaboration, my thesis will also discuss significant barriers towards the technology's wide-scale adoption. Blockchain's flat (non-hierarchical) architecture is not necessarily how Capitalist Society currently organises itself. So I'll finish with a call to arms. My dear audience, if like me, you believe inequality is best addressed by challenging traditional hierarchies, then, just as the #metoo campaign has begun to undermine patriarchal power structures, it is up to all of us to say: "enough is enough!" Go and create, participate and collaborate with your peers - I challenge you to refute those traditional hierarchical power structures, show that flat and cooperative is best, and Be the Change You Wish To See in the World.
