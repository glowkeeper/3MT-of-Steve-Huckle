My work investigates whether blockchain technology is the means by which communities can collaborate. Conway's Law states that if you want a mutually collaborative network, you need a networked system of mutual collaboration. Blockchains are a distributed database technology formed of an immutable chain of transactions. They are independent of any single (controlling) entity because nodes on a blockchain network are equally privileged and mutually cooperative. Furthermore, they have inbuilt capabilities for secure communication. Hence, blockchains include properties desirable for trusted cooperation. Thus, they are ideally suited to meeting Conway's criteria.
